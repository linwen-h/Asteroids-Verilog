# Asteroids: Verilog

Asteroids Verilog is built off the idea of the arcade game Asteroids from 1979 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game). This version of the game is built and written in verilog code, to be able to work with a DES-SOC1 board. The game consists of a user controlled ship that can move across the screen and the objective is to shoot bullets in order to break randomly generated asteroids on the screen.
